        <p> 
           I'm a softwhare engineer specializing in building (and designing) exceptional digital experiences.
               I'm a motivated, self-starting individual who has the ability to work independently.
            I have over 500 hours of intensive, project-based training in programming languages and other 
            technical skills such as C#, .NET Core, SQL, Git, GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, Visual Studio,
            VMWare, Unity, Bolt, debugging, and testing.

        </h2>
        <p class="heading-info">
            Hello! My name is Daniel and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My intrest in web
            development started back in 2003 with the creation of Myspace. Little did I know that the seed was 
            planted for my love of web development.  
        </p>
        <p class="heading-info">
            Fast-foward to today, and Ive had the privilege of attending

            bootcamp. That added water to the seed and reignited my passion for development.
            My focus these days have been my rebranding out of the oil and gas industry into the technology world!
