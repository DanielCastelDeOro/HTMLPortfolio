                My SQL - Using My SQL Workbench I utilized a class made BestBuy database with over 300 items with unique product ID’s. 
                There is also an Employee table with full name information along with the current title that person holds. Along with that 
                the database has sales, reviews, and a fully functional catalog. Both projects show examples of data manipulation I’m able 
                to produce.
